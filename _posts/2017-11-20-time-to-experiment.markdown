Day one of quasi-'front end'.
I'm a bit terrified actually. After 18 months of working on Python I've finally
got around to putting together a website to display some of the things I'm working on,
to talk about things I'm reading, etc.

Fun fact: This blog is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
(It actually is a bit easier than I thought it would be.)
