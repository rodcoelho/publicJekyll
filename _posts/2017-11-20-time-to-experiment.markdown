Day one of quasi-'front end'.
I'm a bit terrified actually. After 18 months of working on Python I've finally
got around to putting together a website.

Fun fact: it's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
and I can use Markdown to author my posts.
It actually is a bit easier than I thought it would be.
